## Used Technologies

**1. Java version 8.**

**2. JPA / MONGO DB:** Mapping persistent entities in domains objects.

**3. Spring Data JPA:** It's used to generate part of the code of the persistence layer.

## Additional Technologies

**Database:** For the initial load for the known_word database is based on the known_words.json file. If some problem occur during initial load, it can be made manually e.g: mongoimport --db test --collection known_words --file known_words.json

**Tests:** The tests are defined as use case of the Junit. The tests have been made available in the structure: src/test/java.

**Spring Boot:** Technology used for create a embeded enviroment of the execution, I used this technology for simplify the use of the Spring and for controle the scope of the database. In the file src/main/resources/application.yml have properties of the Spring Boot for the project.

**Maven:** Life cycle management and project build.

## Considerations

The integration of the pages with the data occurs asynchronously, always making access to REST services available.
